# Technical Reflection & Leadership Approach

## How did you approach the trade-off between performance and complexity?

I chose a hybrid architecture combining REST for synchronous validation and Kafka for asynchronous event handling. This balances simplicity and responsiveness at the user level (e.g., validating checkout inputs) with scalability and decoupling in internal services (e.g., inventory, payment). Performance was optimized using Kafka’s high-throughput event bus and by designing each service to perform a single responsibility well, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## How would you make this service resilient in production?

1. Health checks are implemented for all services (/health endpoint).

2. Retry mechanisms and idempotent design are incorporated, especially around payment processing.

3. To avoid processing the same event more than once, we can use tools like Redis to keep track of events we've already handled. This way, if a duplicate event comes in, we can easily spot it and skip reprocessing.

4. Failure-handling services like notification-service and audit-service listen to failure events and ensure incidents are properly recorded and notified.

5. The system is containerized with Docker, which opens the door for Kubernetes-based scaling and self-healing deployments in production.

## How would you onboard a new developer to this service?

1. **Assign a mentor who is experienced with the service** Initial pair programming sessions help in transfer knowledge stage, clarify doubts immediately, and reduce frustration.

2. **Domain Understanding**
The first and most important step is to ensure the new developer understands the domain well. The service relies heavily on domain-specific concepts, so investing time in explaining the business context, workflows, and core entities is crucial. This reduces guesswork and aligns development with business goals.

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
Good documentation is a foundation for onboarding. This should include:
 - ***Setup Instructions***: Step-by-step guide to get the development environment up and running without friction.
 - ***Business Documentation***: Clear, high-level explanations of the domain, business processes, and service purpose.
 - ***Architecture Diagrams & Component Overview***: Visual aids such as system architecture, service interaction diagrams, and component breakdowns to help the developer understand the system structure quickly.
- ***Tooling and CI/CD Familiarity***: Provide clear guidance on how to use the project’s tooling, build systems, deployment pipelines, and monitoring dashboards to give the new developer a full view of the service lifecycle.

4. **Simplified Development Environment with Mocks**
To avoid dependencies on unstable or complex backend services during development, provide mocks or stubs for external systems and services. This allows the developer to focus on writing and testing code locally, speeding up feedback and reducing waiting times.

5. **Engage with “Fun” Components First**
Start the developer’s work on parts of the system that are interesting or have clear, self-contained functionality. This helps build motivation, confidence, and familiarity with the codebase without overwhelming them with complex or critical components immediately.

## If you joined Flaschenpost, how would you plan the transition from monolith to microservices?

1. **Identify bounded contexts**: Break down the monolith by business domains (e.g., checkout, inventory, payment).

2. **Identify Component Dependencies**: Map out dependencies between components.

3. **Extract low-risk services first**: Start with stateless or helper services like validation or notification

4. **Strangle pattern**: Route new functionality to microservices while the old monolith remains in place.

5. **Build a Strong Integration Strategy**
Define how the microservices will communicate - commonly via asynchronous messaging (events) or APIs - and how they will integrate back with the monolith during the transition phase. Use an API Gateway requests properly.

6. **Ensure Data Ownership and Consistency**
Break up the monolithic database by moving data ownership into each microservice. Implement patterns like Saga(Choreography) for handling distributed transactions and eventual consistency to keep data in sync across services.

7. **Train Teams and Promote DevOps Culture**
Microservices increase operational complexity. Invest in team training, encourage ownership of services, and embrace DevOps practices for smooth development, deployment, and maintenance.

8. **Be Ready to Roll Back and Take It Step by Step**
Things don’t always go as planned, so it’s important to have a way to undo changes if something goes wrong. Use tools like feature toggles to turn features on or off easily, and introduce changes gradually instead of all at once. This helps catch problems early and keeps the transition smooth and low-risk.


## How would you integrate AI tools into your development workflow (e.g., design, code, testing, docs)?

AI tools are essential today but must be used carefully, especially by junior developers. My approach:

1. Use ChatGPT or Copilot for brainstorming, generating utility code, writing documentation, and checking grammar or typos.

2. Rely on AI-assisted testing with clear prompts and senior-level code review to ensure quality and maintainability.

3. Allow AI to assist in writing API docs, README files, error messages, and configuration templates to save time.

## If you had access to an AI assistant (like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT), how would you delegate tasks to it, and how would you ensure its outputs are trustworthy and maintainable?

### I would delegate to AI:
1. Repetitive tasks like writing test cases or documentation.

2. Generating boilerplate code (e.g., API stubs, Kafka producers/consumers)    

3. Translating technical concepts into readable documentation.

### To ensure trustworthiness:
1. Always review AI-generated code before committing.

2. Compare it against known design patterns and best practices.

3. Use unit tests and linting to validate the output quality.

4. Encourage team members to validate AI usage via peer reviews.

## What responsibilities (if any) could AI take on as a "team member" in your squad?

1. Acting as a code assistant, suggesting improvements or generating boilerplate

2. Supporting the documentation process, both technical and business-facing.

3. Helping with test coverage analysis and proposing new tests.

4. Serving as a review partner for typos, inconsistencies, and redundant logic.

5. Assisting in root cause analysis when integrated with logs and error tracking.

*** However, developers must be trained on ethical and effective AI usage. If everyone understands how to use AI correctly, we can treat it as a powerful and reliable team member. ***
